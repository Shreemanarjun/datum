A powerful, offline-first data synchronization engine for Flutter and Dart, featuring relational data support, real-time queries, and intelligent conflict resolution.

Datum is the evolution of `synq_manager`, rebuilt to handle complex, connected data models with ease, while providing a seamless and reactive developer experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Offline-First by Design**: Full CRUD functionality without a network connection. Operations are queued and synced automatically when online.
- **Relational Data Support**: Natively define and sync one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between your data models.
- **Reactive Queries**: Build dynamic UIs that update in real-time with `watchAll`, `watchById`, and `watchQuery`.
- **Intelligent Conflict Resolution**: Built-in strategies like `LastWriteWins` and support for custom resolvers to handle data conflicts gracefully.
- **Pluggable Architecture**: Backend-agnostic. Use provided adapters for common backends (Firebase, Supabase, REST) or create your own.
- **Robust & Reliable**: Features schema migrations, multi-user support, and resilient sync with automatic retries.
