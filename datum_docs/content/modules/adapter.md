# Adapter Module

The Adapter module in Datum is responsible for handling data interactions with various sources, both local and remote. It provides a standardized interface for fetching, storing, and synchronizing data, abstracting away the underlying storage mechanisms.

## Key Components:

-   **Local Adapter:** Manages data operations with local storage solutions.
-   **Remote Adapter:** Facilitates data exchange with remote servers and APIs.
