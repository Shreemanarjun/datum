# Contributing to Datum

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Datum! It's people like you that make Datum such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/shreemanarjun/datum/issues/new)! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

### Fork & create a branch

git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-translations
